# Tiny Habits

## 1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
* The most interesting story in the video for me was the push-up example. BJ Fogg explained that instead of forcing himself to do many push-ups, he started with just two push-ups after using the bathroom. Because the action was very small and easy, he was able to do it consistently every day. Over time, this tiny habit sometimes naturally grew into doing more push-ups. This showed me that starting small is more powerful than starting big.

## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
* B = MAP means Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability and Prompt come together.

    * M – Motivation  
    * A – Ability  
    * P – Prompt  

* To make habits easier, we should focus more on Ability. If the habit is very small and simple, we will do it even without strong motivation. We should also attach it to an existing routine as a prompt.


## 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
* “Shine” means celebrating after completing a habit. It is important because our brain learns from positive feelings. When we celebrate, even in a small way, the brain wants to repeat that behavior again. Whatever we celebrate becomes a habit.

## 4. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
* The most interesting idea for me was that small improvements every day can lead to big changes over time. The video showed that if we focus on being just 1% better each day, even tiny progress adds up. It made me realize that we don’t need big changes at once — small steps consistently are more powerful.

## 5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?
* The book says that habits are not just about what we do, but who we think we are. If we see ourselves as the kind of person who reads, exercises, or stays organized, we are more likely to do those habits. Identity comes first, then habits follow.


## 6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
* The book says to make a habit easier by breaking it down into smaller steps. If a habit feels simple and quick, we are more likely to do it. Also, reducing friction and making the environment supportive helps make the habit easier.

## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
* To make a habit harder, the book suggests adding friction or obstacles. We can make bad habits less convenient by removing triggers, increasing effort, or making the environment unattractive. When it is not easy to do, we do it less often.

## 8. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
* I want to make running a daily habit.
    -   To make the cue obvious, I will keep my running shoes near my bed so I see them in the morning.  
    -   To make it attractive, I will listen to my favorite music while running.  
    -   To make it easy, I will start with just 10 minutes walks instead of long runs.  
    -   To make it satisfying, I will track my progress in Apps and feel proud after completing it.

## 9. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
### Question 9
* I want to reduce the habit of sleeping late and waking up late.
    - To make the cue invisible, I will avoid using my phone at night and keep it away from my bed.  
    - To make it unattractive, I will remind myself how tired and unproductive I feel the next day.  
    - To make it hard, I will set a fixed bedtime and turn off the lights early.  
    - To make it satisfying to wake up early, I will plan something positive in the morning like running or listening to music.
